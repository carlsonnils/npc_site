Website for my thoughts


### Intial Blog Ideas
 - Humans need true recognition
 - Everything is connected at the fundamental level
 - Different "Academic Areas" are different ways of trying to understand the same thing
 - What if We did not live in a society with the same structure 
 - Humans natrually want to recognize other humans. we want to understand the intent of other matter that has the ability to affect me. Cities where there are too many people to process the intention of everyone causes me too have anxiety. The anxiety is about the uncertainty that a human that i do not understand the intent of will affect me in an unexpected negative way. This thought is purely a thought. Reality shows that if the state of your world changes you can change with it. 
 - There is no such thing as progress only application of further knowledge and understanding.
