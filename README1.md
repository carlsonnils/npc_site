## Ideas & Contemplations <a name="ideas"></a>
 - Humans need true recognition
 - Everything is connected at the fundamental level
 - Different "Academic Areas" are different ways of trying to understand the same thing
 - What if We did not live in a society with the same structure 
 - Humans natrually want to recognize other humans. we want to understand the intent of other matter that has the ability to affect me. Cities where there are too many people to process the intention of everyone causes me too have anxiety. The anxiety is about the uncertainty that a human that i do not understand the intent of will affect me in an unexpected negative way. This thought is purely a thought. Reality shows that if the state of your world changes you can change with it. 
 - There is no such thing as progress only application of further knowledge and understanding.
 - a human is not what they have done or what they have done to get what they have. Human beings are what they do. The infintesimal period of time that is right now is the only thing that affects your being. The past is a memory. Is it that people who dont want the world to change are also the people who cannot accept that only what happens in this moment affects them now.
 - only what is happening now affects me now. what happened in the past does not affect me now. Live in the now. Understand the now. 
 - Real human wants get lost in the mess of memories and reality. living in the now you can feel real wants and needs. 
 - Complete thoughts about the unknown
 - Many humans cannot do this, while collection of metal, silicon, and electrons can produce complete ideas about an unknown state if the universe.
 - awareness of the particles in the universe and how they interact can explain any phenomenon. granted there is not something completely abstracted from human's ability to comprehend.
 - original thought. Original thought is thought that a human has about the real world that is not in the thoughts of other humans that the original thinker is aware of. is original thought as simple as providing a new perspective to a feeling.
 - feelings cannot be represented by words. feelings can only be communicated by making the other human feel them too.
 - is the the ability to understand multiple perspectives or to quickly drop one thought move to another then back to the furst thought a consequence of deep awareness or is it a capability that some brains have and others do not?
 - romantic relationships. i want someone who understands the world and themsleves. they have to know what they want. they have to be able to understand human wants
 - having a complete original thought means you have an understanding of what you are thinking about. the only to think about something new is to completely understand what is known (at least within the patricles thst interact with what is bring thought about)
